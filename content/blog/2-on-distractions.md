I constantly struggle with what I consider to be "distractions" or "time-wasters" but, no matter how hard I try to control them - I fail. I frequently check for messages, Instagram, HN, Reddit, local news websites and more.

Here are some (but not a complete list of) tools that I used to limit distractions and improve productivity: [SelfControl](https://alternativeto.net/software/selfcontrol/), [Qbserve](https://alternativeto.net/software/qbserve/). For the mobile, I use "Downtimes" and [block access](https://www.imore.com/how-block-specific-websites-being-accessed-safari-iphone-and-ipad) to frequently visited websites.

Even with such limitations I quickly adjust my behavior to bypass blocked content or come up with new time-wasters. I fail and that failure makes me feel miserable.

I gave up and lost control until recently I started working on an interesting side project which consumed my free time and in fact, it consumed most of my distraction time too! I was not interrupting my work by picking up the phone (that often) and I was not wondering on the web to amuse myself. That felt good.

So, I come to the conclusion that **restrictions do not work** and if you are like me, finding something worthwhile which does not necessarily have to be "productive work", something you enjoy more than distractions will eventually solve your problem.
