I constantly struggle with what I consider to be "distractions" or "time-wasters" but, no matter how hard I try to control them - I fail. I frequently check for messages, Instagram, HN, Reddit, local news websites and many more. I might be lost jumping on from one blog post to another.

Here are some of the tools that I use (or used in the past) on my Mac to limit my behavior and boost productivity: [Qbserve](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/), [Focus](https://heyfocus.com/), [Motion](https://www.inmotion.app/), [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/). For the iPhone, I use built-in "Screen Time" and "Downtimes". I also use Web content restrictions to block frequently used websites.

Even with such limitations I quickly adjust behavior to bypass blocked content or I come up with new time-wasters. I fail and that failure makes me feel miserable.

I gave up and lost confidence until recently I started working on an interesting side project which consumed most of my free time. In fact, it consumed most of my distraction times too! I was not picking up the phone that much and I was not wondering on the web to amuse myself. I felt happy.

So, I come to the conclusion that restrictions do not work well and if you are like me, finding something worthwhile, something you enjoy more than distractions will probably solve your problem too.
